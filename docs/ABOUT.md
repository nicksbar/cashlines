# About the Author

## Who I Am

I'm a seasoned IT professional with 20+ years in the field. My journey spans the full spectrum of technology—from infrastructure and networking to development, DevOps, and AI. I've worn every hat: support specialist, system administrator, network engineer, software developer, and everything in between. I've broken systems, fixed them, learned from both, and built expertise across Windows, Linux, hardware, and software ecosystems.

Beyond the technical resume, I'm someone who genuinely enjoys solving problems and understanding how things work at every level.

## Why Cashlines Exists

For years, I tried traditional budgeting apps and methods. They all failed spectacularly. Budgets felt like constraints that immediately broke under real-world pressure, providing nothing but friction and frustration.

Then I had a realization: **I don't need budgets. I need visibility.**

Instead of trying to predict and constrain where money *should* go, I needed to understand where it *actually* goes. The allocation breakdown. The ratios. The trends. 

This shift changed everything.

By tracking income allocation and expense splits, I discovered patterns I couldn't see before:
- How much of my income actually remains after taxes and deductions
- Where discretionary spending accumulates over time
- Seasonal spending habits I wasn't aware of
- How my allocation percentages actually compare to my stated priorities

This data-driven approach eliminated the failed budget cycle and replaced it with honest financial awareness. I started making smarter decisions about credit card usage, identifying spending trends, and adjusting my habits based on real data—not arbitrary budgets.

**Cashlines is that system, refined and shared.**

## The Philosophy

This tool is built on a simple principle: **tracking beats budgeting**.

- No arbitrary spending limits
- No guilt-inducing budget failures
- Just clear visibility into your money flow
- Honest allocation ratios
- Pattern recognition that drives better decisions

It's designed for people who:
- Want to understand their money without constraint
- Think in percentages and allocations, not line-item budgets
- Value visibility and trends over prediction and control
- Believe in data-driven personal finance decisions

## What I Built

Cashlines is a self-hosted personal finance tracker that focuses on the question: "Where is my money, and what ratios does it follow?"

It includes:
- **Income tracking** with automatic tax/deduction calculations
- **Flexible expense tracking** with allocation splits across categories
- **Automated routing rules** to standardize your allocation patterns
- **Monthly reporting** to spot trends and understand your flow
- **Complete privacy** - your financial data stays on your hardware
- **Full control** - no subscriptions, no tracking, no external dependencies

## Technical Background

The tool is built with modern web technology (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and designed to be self-hosted on Docker or LXC for maximum privacy and control. It's production-ready and open source.

## The Goal

I built Cashlines for people like me—those who've learned that understanding beats budgeting, and that honest financial data drives better decisions than arbitrary constraints ever could.

If you're tired of budgeting apps that fail you, and you want real visibility into your money flow, Cashlines might be exactly what you've been looking for.
